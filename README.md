# Hubrovments

A userstyle (and possibly userscript in the future) for making Github nicer to use.

## Why
I started using GitHub for private projects and after a while I noticed a few niggles, I use this userstyle to make my life easier.


## Features

* Sticky the issues toolbar. (uses `position: sticky;`)
* And that is it for now, submit pull requests!

`position: sticky;` is avalible in Fx26+ but needs to be enabled in about:config under `layout.css.sticky.enabled`
